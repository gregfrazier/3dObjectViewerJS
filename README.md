# 3dObjectViewerJS
JavaScript 3D Object Viewer using Canvas

View 3D Objects in "object space", can only handle one continous strip of vertexes. So models with seperate pieces are not supported.

Very primitive. 
Has single source lighting & texturing (auto generated texture from http://ricardocabello.com/blog/post/710)

This was more of an experiment and learning experience than an actual product. I don't recommend using this for anything.
